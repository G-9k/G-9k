## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Buenos Aires with interests in AI Safety, physics, and science communication. I have completed foundational courses in LLMs and AI Safety, exploring reinforcement learning concepts applied to safety challenges. Beyond technical studies, I am passionate about writing and aim to bridge technical expertise with effective communication, contributing to projects that advance technological progress and public understanding. I am actively seeking opportunities that combine my technical background with my communication skills and creative interests.
